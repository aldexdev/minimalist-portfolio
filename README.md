# Personal Milimalist Portfolio

My personal minimalist portfolio based on Bartosz Jarocki's and developed using the stack above.

### STACK

1. Astro
2. Typescript
3. Ninja-keys

## How to try it

First of all, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, you can run the app using:

```
npm run dev
```

To build the app, run the command below:

```
npm run build
```

Enjoy!

## How it works

To change the information displayed on the page, you must edit the file cv.json with your own data.

Pressing Cmd/Ctrl + K will display a command palette where you can visit the links provided or print the full CV in PDF.
